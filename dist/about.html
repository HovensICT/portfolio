            Hello!
            <br/>I am Guido Hovens. I am 18 years old and currently studying for my Dutch VWO diploma, which is roughly equivalent to the Brittish A levels. While studying the mandatory classes I took extra classes in ICT, English and German. For the latter two I have recieved my CEFR level C2 and B2 certificates respectively.
            <br/>Below, you can see my last three jobs.
          </p>

          <h3>Jumbo</h3>
          <h6>2017 - Present</h6>
          <h6>Merchandiser</h6>
          <p>
            I began working in the Jumbo supermarket in February of 2017 as a Merchandiser at the dry goods department (Dutch: DKW; droge kruidenierswaren). At this department I learnt the norms and values of the company, mainly that the customer is king. I still love helping customers, even though I have limited time to put the goods on the shelves, I always find time for a friendly chat with a customer. After approximately a year I was relocated to the produce department, (Dutch: AGF; Aardappelen, Groente en Fruit) which came with a lot more responsibilities. These included being the only employee of my department, filling in my own schedule and, of course, ensuring customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, working in this department means working alone most of the time and I really do like socialising with colleagues.
            <br/>I still love going to work, especially for my, for lack of a better translation of the Dutch word "Gezellige", sociable colleagues.

          <h3>Spotta</h3>
          <h6>2015 - 2017</h6>
          <h6>Flyer destributer</h6>
          <p>
            I started delivering packets of folders containing adverts in 2015. Mostly because I was too young to work in a supermarket, but also because this employer would allow me to choose on which day I would deliver the flyers over a three-day period (sat-mon). That gave me a sense of responsibility. the neighbourhood where I delivered the flyers was a 10 minute cylcle away from home, where the packets would be deliverd. Now multiply that eightfold, because that is how many times I woud have to cycle to and fro to get all the packets deliverd. Then add the time for delivering them and you will get about three to five hours a week. In that time I was not only delivering adverts, but also reminding people they had left their keys in the door or help someone catch their dog.
            <br/>I liked those parts of the job, but I could not stand delivering in the rain or the snow. So I sent a resume to the supermarket right around the corner, and could start working there exactly the week after my last time delivering the folders. How is that for timing?

          <h3>Mediaverspreiders</h3>
          <h6>2013 - 2014</h6>
          <h6>Newspaper destributer</h6>
          <p>
            This was my first job. Unfortunately it was not exactly how I expected it to be. I needed to deliver newspapers on wednesdays and fridays. However, I really did not like it. The papers would make my hands turn black, it would always rain and because I had to deliver them on those two weekdays, I had to do it after school, which is tiring in and of itself. Especially if you keep in mind that I would cycle 11 Km to school and back every day. That is the main reason why I only worked for thes employer for a year.
            <br/>However, I did like to remind people of their keys still being in the lock. This one time I saw groceries sitting in the window-sill. So I rung the bell and the homeowner was very grateful. Those were really the only things I enjoyed about delivering the paper. Well thats not entirely true. At the end of the year, right before christmas, the paperboys will walk their route and ring every bell. If someone opens they wish them happy holidays and will, most of the time, recieve a small compensation from the homeowners. That actually got me more money than delivering the papers for six months.
            <br/>Maybe I did not like the job because I was too young, but at least I tried and got experience out of it.
